# API

Rendora can be configured when the config `server.enable` is set to `true` to provide another HTTP server listening to the port `9242` by default (can be changed using the config file) in order to provide more info and metrics. Currently there are 2 HTTP endpoints

- **rendering**: provides a JSON response that contains the SSR'ed HTML page, its status code and headers.
  - endpoint: `POST /render`
  - request body: A serialized json object that contains:
    - `uri`: the request uri (e.g. `/posts`)
  - response body: A serialized json object that contains:
    - `content`: the SSR'ed HTML page
    - `status`: the status code
    - `headers`: response headers
    - `latency`: latency in milliseconds for the SSR operation
- **metrics**: provides Prometheus metrics
  - endpoint: `GET /metrics`
  - Rendora's metrics:
    - `rendora_requests_total`: provides a counter corresponding to the number of total requests (i.e. both whitelisted and blacklisted requests)
    - `rendora_requests_ssr`: provides a counter corresponding to the number of total whitelisted requests
    - `rendora_requests_ssr_cached`: provides a counter corresponding to the number of cached whitelisted requests
    - `rendora_latency_ssr`: provides a historgram for SSR latency in milliseconds for uncached SSR'ed requests with buckets of values `[50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 500]`
