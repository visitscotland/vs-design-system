            Any ascent in snow requires a high degree of fitness, winter equipment and the
            skills to use them and mountaineering and navigation experience. Bear in mind
            snow can cover parts of the 'tourist' path into the summer months. If you're at
            all unsure, local mountain guides can advise and guide you to the summit and back.

            Make sure you fill in a mountain safety route card and leave it with someone you trust.

            Best route for: Experienced hillwalkers
        </VsHeading>

        <p>
            Carn Mor Dearg Arête is the mountain’s other walking route , a challenging
            ridge climb which should only be attempted by experienced scramblers
            and physically-fit hill walkers. Though demanding, the route rewards
            walkers with the finest possible views of the mountain’s North face.
            Starting from the North Face car park at Torlundy, the trail traverses
            not one but two Munros, the Carn Mor Dearg and Ben Nevis. It can also
            be reached by following the Mountain Track to the ‘halfway lochan’,
            then taking the left fork whilst the right fork continues along the
            Mountain Track. You’ll pass the CIC Hut, a private shelter for mountaineers.
            A longer and more strenuous walk than the Mountain Track, this spectacular
            route can take between 10-11 hours with scrambles across boulders.
            It requires a good head for heights and careful navigation across the
            trickier exposed sections.

        <p>
            Although the Mountain Track is reasonably easy to follow on a clear day,
            it's essential to have both a map and a compass and know how to use them
            especially if there is poor visibility during the climb.
