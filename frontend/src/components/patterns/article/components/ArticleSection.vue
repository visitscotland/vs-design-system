        There are two main walking routes up Ben Nevis. The Mountain Track
        (sometimes called the Tourist Track or the Pony Track) is used by most walkers,
        whilst the Carn Mor Dearg ArÃªte route presents a more challenging climb
        for more experienced hikers.

            The difficulty of this hike is often under-estimated so always be

            Any ascent in snow requires a high degree of fitness, winter equipment and the
            skills to use them and mountaineering and navigation experience. Bear in mind
            snow can cover parts of the 'tourist' path into the summer months. If you're at
            all unsure, local mountain guides can advise and guide you to the summit and back.

            Make sure you fill in a mountain safety route card and leave it with someone you trust.
