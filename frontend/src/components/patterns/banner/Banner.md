## Usage
The banner component sits below the main navigation at the top of a page across its full width highlighting important information for all users to see. It pushes content down rather than sitting on top of other elements.   

A user can remove the banner from a page using the close button and if the user allows cookies, the banner wonâ€™t reappear until their next session. 

Only one banner should ever be displayed at one time.

### Standard
The banner must contain a title and call to action link to more information. It may also include extra text content for better description.  

```jsx
    <VsBanner>
        <template slot="bannerTitle">

        </template>

        <template slot="bannerText">
            <p>
                Find the latest information on travel, and Good to Go (Covid-safe)
                businesses. 
            </p>
        </template>

        <template slot="bannerCta">
