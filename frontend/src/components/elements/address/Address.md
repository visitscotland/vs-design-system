## Usage
Use the address component to display contact information for a person, 
people or organisation. It can include an address, URL, email 
address, phone number, social media handle, geographic coordinates etc. 

Each line in the address should be wrapped in a `<span>` so that each one sits 
on a new line on the page. 

  ```js
    <VsAddress>
        <span>Edinburgh Castle,</span>
        <span>Castle Hill,</span>
        <span>Edinburgh,</span>
        <span>City of Edinburgh,</span>
        <span>EH1 2NG</span>
    </VsAddress>

  ```
