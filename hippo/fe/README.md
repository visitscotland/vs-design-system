This package is an example webpack build that consumes the component library assets from the VisitScotland.com design system and uses them in a Hippo CMS site.

## Setup

```
yarn
```

This installs the package's dependencies **and also creates a symlink to the vs-dotcom-ds root dependency**. This means that any changes to the **local** root package are reflected in this package automatically (on rebuild).

## Use

```
yarn build
```
