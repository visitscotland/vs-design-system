Just opposite the wonderful museum, hop on board the ship which has travelled to the ends of the earth and back! Captain Scott and his hardy crew reached the then undiscovered polar region of Antarctica in the early 1900s in one of the most significant expeditions to have ever been undertaken. Wander through the ship, see objects that belonged to Scott and his men, and discover their brave tales of seafaring and difficulties in the Antarctic. At this family attraction, there's plenty of engaging things to see and do that kids will really enjoy.",
